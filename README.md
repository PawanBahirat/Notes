## Data Structures

### Arrays
<hr>

- Introduction :

An array also referred to as a collection of elements, is the simplest and most widely used Data Structure. Most of the Data Structures (e.g.Stack and Queue) were derived using the Array structure, which is why it is known as one of the central building blocks of Data Structures. These Data Structures will be discussed later in the coming chapters. The purpose of an Array is to group similar kinds of data for fast access.

Look at the figure below; we have made a simple array with four elements. Each item in the collection is called a Data Element, and the number of data elements stored in an Array is known as its size. You can see that each data element has a maximum of two neighbors, except the first and last one.

- Array Indexing : 

Each data element is assigned a numerical value called the index, which corresponds to the position of that item in the array. It is important to note that the value of the index is non-negative and always starts from zero. So the first element of an array will be stored at index 0 and the last one at index size-1.

An index makes it possible to access the contents of the array directly. Otherwise, we would have to traverse through the whole array to access a single element. That is the key feature that differentiates Arrays from Linked lists (we will cover them in the next chapter).

- Types Of Arrays :

Arrays can store primitive data-type values (e.g., int, char, floats, boolean, byte, short, long, etc.), non-primitive data-type values (e.g., Java Objects, etc.) or it can even hold references of other arrays. That divides the arrays into two categories:

One Dimensional Array
Multi-Dimensional Array
In primitive array, values are stored in a contiguous memory location. Whereas, in the non-primitive array, objects are stored in the heap segment.

- One-Dimensional Array :

The basic syntax for declaring and initializing the one-dimensional array is given below:

- Array Declaration :

In the array declaration, reference of an array is created. To declare an array, you have to specify the data type and name of the array.
```java
datatype arrayName[]; or datatype[] arrayName;
```
Example Program
```java
class OneDArray{ 
    public static void main(String  args[]){
        //Declaration Syntax
        int myArray1[];
        int[] myArray2;
    }
}
```
The above declarations will tell the compiler that reference variables myArray1and myArray2 will hold an array of type int. For now, no actual array exists. To link these reference variables with the actual physical array, we have to create one using the new operator.

- Array Initialization : 

Array initialization actually gives memory to the elements of an array. The basic syntax for initializing an array is given below:
```java
arrayName = new type [size];
```
- Initialization and Declaration in One Step :

We can also declare and initialize the array in one step.
```java
datatype[] arrayName = new datatype [size]; or datatype arrayName[] = new datatype [size];
```
- Practice Problem üëç

[Sum of Array Elements.](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sum-of-array-elements2502/1)

- Adding or Updating Elements in an Array :

To add or update the element in an array, we specify the particular index and assign the new value.
```java
arrayName[index] = value;
```

- How are arrays stored in memory? 

In Java, arrays are dynamically allocated. Arrays are stored in the memory using a reference pointer, which points to the first element. For example, if we create an array of size 3 and name it myArray, then the variable will point to the start of the array. See the figure below:

The only drawback of using arrays is that we have to specify the size of the array during the time of instantiation. That means the size remains fixed and can not be extended. If we want to add more elements, we will have to create a new array, copy all the items from the old array to the new one, and then insert the new element.

### 2D Array
<hr>

- Introduction : 

The Java 2D arrays are arranged as arrays of arrays, i.e., each element of a 2D array is another array. These are generally used if we want to store the data items in a table or matrix-like structure. The representation of the elements is in rows and columns. Thus, we can get a total number of elements in a multidimensional array by multiplying row size with column size.

Like 1D arrays, 2D arrays must have values of the same data type.

- Declaration :
Syntax -
```java
data_type [] [] array_name = new data_type[row_size][column_size];
```
```java
int [][] arr = new int[3][4];
```

This line will create a pointer to store a 2D array. The size of this 2D array is 3 by 4, which means arr holds three 1D arrays, having 4 elements in each.

- Representation of above 2D array in tabular format :
  
| Column 0  | Column 1  | Column 2   | Column 3  |
| :-------  | :-------  | :-------   | :-------  |
| `a[0][0]` | `a[0][1]` | `a[0][2]`  | `a[0][3]` |
| `a[1][0]` | `a[1][1]` | `a[1][2]`  | `a[1][3]` |
| `a[2][0]` | `a[2][1]` | `a[2][2]`  | `a[2][3]` |

- Initialization :
  
There are various ways to initialize a 2D array with values.

The traditional method is to assign values to each element. 
```java
int [][] arr =new int [3][4]; //assigning 10 at Row 2 and Column 1 arr[2][1]=10;
```
We can also initialize it with the declaration itself. 
```java
int[][] arr = { { 1, 2, 3, 4 }, { 5, 6, 7, 8 }, {9, 10, 11, 12} };
```
We can also initialize or assign the values using a loop. 
```java
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++) { arr[i][j]=i+j; } }
```

- Printing 2D array in tabular format :

```java
public class Main {
public static void main(String args[]) {
      int[][] arr = {  { 1, 2, 3, 4 }, 
                   { 5, 6, 7, 8 }, 
                   {9, 10, 11, 12} };
                   
     for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
 	    	 System.out.print(arr[i][j]+" ");
        }  
        System.out.println();
     }
}
}
```

### Remove Even Integers From An Array
<hr>

Given an array of size n, remove all even integers from it. Implement this solution in Java and see if it runs without an error.

In this problem, you have to implement the int [] removeEven(int[] arr) method, which removes all the even elements from the array and returns back updated array.

- Method Prototype :
```java
int[] removeEven(int[] arr);
```
- Input :
An array with integers.

- Output :
An array with only odd integers.

- Sample Input :
```java
arr = {1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 6, 3}
```
- Sample Output :
```java
arr = {1, 5, 3}
```
**SOLUTION**
- CODE :
```java
class CheckRemoveEven {
  
	public static int[] removeEven(int[] arr) {
		int oddElements = 0;

		//Find number of odd elements in arr
		for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
			if (arr[i] % 2 != 0) oddElements++;
		}

		//Create result array with the size equal to the number of odd elements in arr
		int[] result = new int[oddElements];
		int result_index = 0;

		//Put odd values from arr to the resulted array
		for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
			if (arr[i] % 2 != 0) 
        result[result_index++] = arr[i];
		} //end of for loop

		return result;
	} //end of removeEven


  public static void main(String args[]) {
  
    int size = 10;
    int[] arr = new int[size]; //declaration and instantiation 
  
    System.out.print("Before removing Even Numbers: "); 
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      arr[i] = i; // assigning values
      System.out.print(arr[i] +  " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
  
    int[] newArr =  removeEven(arr); // calling removeEven
  
    System.out.print("After removing Even Numbers: "); 
    for (int i = 0; i < newArr.length; i++) {
      System.out.print(newArr[i] +  " "); // prinitng array
    }
  }
}
```
- Explanation :

This solution first finds the number of odd elements in the given array by iterating over it and incrementing a count variable if an element is odd.

Next, we initialize an array with a size oddElements, and store all the odd numbers in it.

- Time Complexity :

Since the entire array has to be iterated over, this solution is in O(n).

### Merge Two Sorted Arrays
<hr>

- Problem Statement :
In this problem, given two sorted arrays, you have to implement the int[] mergeArrays(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) method, which returns an array consisting of all elements of both arrays in a sorted way.

- Method Prototype :
int[] mergeArrays(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) Here arr1 and arr2 are sorted already.

- Sample Input :
```java
arr1 = {1, 3, 4, 5}
arr2 = {2, 6, 7, 8}
```
- Sample Output :
```java
arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
````
**SOLUTION**
- CODE :
```java
class checkMergeArray { 

  // Merge arr1 and arr2 into resultantArray
  public static int[] mergeArrays(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) { 
    int s1 = arr1.length;
    int s2 = arr2.length;
    int[] resultantArray = new int[s1+s2];
    int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;

    // Traverse both array 
    while (i < s1 && j < s2) { 
      // Check if current element of first 
      // array is smaller than current element 
      // of second array. If yes, store first 
      // array element and increment first array 
      // index. Otherwise do same with second array 
      if (arr1[i] < arr2[j]) 
        resultantArray[k++] = arr1[i++]; 
      else
        resultantArray[k++] = arr2[j++]; 
    } 

    // Store remaining elements of first array 
    while (i < s1) 
      resultantArray[k++] = arr1[i++]; 

    // Store remaining elements of second array 
    while (j < s2) 
      resultantArray[k++] = arr2[j++]; 

    return resultantArray;
  } 

  public static void main(String args[]) {

    int[] arr1 = {1,12,14,17,23}; // creating a sorted array called arr1
    int[] arr2 = {11,19,27};  // creating a sorted array called arr2

    int[] resultantArray = mergeArrays(arr1, arr2); // calling mergeArrays

    System.out.print("Arrays after merging: ");
    for(int i = 0; i < arr1.length + arr2.length; i++) {
      System.out.print(resultantArray[i] + " ");
    }
  }
}
```
- Explanation : 

In the solution above, we start by creating a new empty array of the size equal to the sum of sizes of input arrays. Starting off from the index 0 individually compare the elements at corresponding indexes of both arrays. Place the element with smaller value in the resultant array, and increment the index of the array where you find the smallest element. Keep repeating this till you hit the end of one array. Move the elements of the other array into the resultantArray as it is.

Now you‚Äôve got the sorted resultantArray!

- Time Complexity :

The time complexity for this algorithm is O(n+m), where nn and mm are the sizes of arr1 and arr2, respectively. This is because both arrays are iterated over once.
